My talk for the San Diego Data Science meetup: http://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Data-Science-R-Users-Group/events/170967362/

About:

* Setup [StarCluster](http://star.mit.edu/cluster/) to launch EC2 instances
* Running IPython Notebook on Amazon EC2
* Running single node Machine Learning jobs using multiple cores
* Distributing jobs with IPython parallel to multiple EC2 instances
